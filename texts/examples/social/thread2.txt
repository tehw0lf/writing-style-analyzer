Hot take: Docker isn't always the answer.

Yes, containers solve many problems. But they also add complexity. For simple projects, traditional deployment might be perfectly fine.

Consider:
- Does your app need complex dependencies?
- Are you deploying to multiple environments?
- Do you have the infrastructure to manage containers?

If you answered no to most of these, you might not need Docker yet. Don't let FOMO drive your architecture decisions.

That said, learning Docker is valuable. Just don't force it where it doesn't fit.
