### Research Context

German connectors (Konnektoren) play a crucial role in scientific writing by:
- Strengthening coherence and cohesion
- Making logical connections explicit
- Establishing relationships between arguments
- Signaling text structure and argumentation flow

According to research on scientific German, certain connector categories are "wissenschaftstypisch" (science-typical), appearing with higher frequency in academic texts than in general language use.

### Classification System

English academic transition words are typically organized into four main categories:

1. **Additive transitions** - Adding or emphasizing information
2. **Adversative transitions** - Contrasting or presenting alternatives
3. **Causal transitions** - Showing cause-effect relationships
4. **Sequential transitions** - Indicating time order or structure

These categories are widely recognized in academic writing instruction and align with discourse marker research in applied linguistics.

## Methodology

The base pattern files (`german_academic.yaml`, `english_academic.yaml`) were compiled by:

1. **Cross-referencing multiple sources** - Ensuring words appear in at least 2-3 authoritative sources
2. **Academic focus** - Prioritizing connectors appropriate for scholarly writing
3. **Semantic organization** - Grouping by function (additive, contrastive, causal, etc.)
4. **Citation transparency** - All sources documented and verifiable

## Limitations and Disclaimers

1. **Not exhaustive** - These lists represent common academic connectors, not all possible variants
2. **Context-dependent** - Some words may function differently based on context
3. **Register variation** - Formality levels may vary within academic writing
4. **Evolving language** - Academic writing conventions change over time

## User-Specific Patterns

The analyzer supplements these base patterns with:
- **LLM-discovered patterns** from your specific texts
- **Frequency data** from your actual writing
- **Context-specific usage** patterns unique to your style

See `linguistic_patterns/user/` directory for personalized patterns (gitignored).
